# QuantumMeasurementEngine
These are the python scripts that perform the numnerical analysis and plotting of a single temperature quantum measurement engine, operating on a qubit.
There are two similar systems, a refrigerator and a heat engine. The cycle is the same for both but they differ in terms of the definitions of their perfomance ratios.
